    CACE (ELK): ELK is implemented to audit the execution of privileged functionality
    at the application level. The ISSO has configured ELK such that privileged functionality
    (e.g. ability to configure access permissions) has been identified, logged, and
    audited.

    System-generated audit report identifying privileged functions are logged and audited independently. CACE UAR forms are used to track user and level of access. Kibana stores all activity logs and can be queried for audit information.

    CACE (ELK): The Kibana dashboard has been configured by the ISSO such that the auditor role can isolate a particular application component and run reports and view logs on that specific component.

    CACE (ELK): ELK has been configured such that whenever an audit processing failure occurs on logs from the application layer error messages are automatically emailed to the CBP SOD. If audit capacity is reached the application logs are configured to overwrite the oldest data first.
