    Contingency Plan

    In this module, we'll assist you in preparing a Contingency Plan document
    prior to the occurence of a disruption the guidelines and procedures for a 
    service disruption including:

    * notification and activation
    * recovery
    * reconstitution

  title: Three Phases (pre)
  prompt: |
    Will you leverage the template Three Phases (Activation and Notification, Recovery, and Reconstitution) statement used for CACE information systems?

    Agency boilerplate:

    > This plan has been developed to recover and reconstitute the [[Information System Name]]; using a three-phased approach.  The approach ensures that system recovery and reconstitution efforts are performed in a methodical sequence to maximize the effectiveness of the recovery and reconstitution efforts and minimize system outage time due to errors and omissions.  The three system recovery phases consist of activation and notification, recovery, and reconstitution.
    > 
    > 1. **Activation and Notification Phase**.  Activation of the ISCP occurs after a disruption, outage, or disaster that may reasonably extend beyond the RTO established for a system.  The outage event may result in severe damage to the facility that houses the system, severe damage or loss of equipment, or other damage that typically results in long-term loss.
    > Once the ISCP is activated, the information system stakeholders are notified of a possible long-term outage, and a thorough outage assessment is performed for the information system.  Information from the outage assessment is analyzed and may be used to modify recovery procedures specific to the cause of the outage.
    > 2. **Recovery Phase.**  The Recovery phase details the activities and procedures for recovery of the affected system.  Activities and procedures are written at a level such that an appropriately skilled technician can recover the system without intimate system knowledge.  This phase includes notification and awareness escalation procedures for communication of recovery status to system stakeholders.
    > 3. **Reconstitution.**  The Reconstitution phase defines the actions taken to test and validate system capability and functionality at the original or new permanent location.  This phase consists of two major activities: validating data and operational functionality followed by deactivation of the plan.
    > 
    > During validation, the system is tested and validated as operational prior to returning operation to its normal state.  Validation procedures include functionality or regression testing, concurrent processing, and/or data validation.  The system is declared recovered and operational by upon successful completion of validation testing.
    > 
    > Deactivation includes activities to notify users of system operational status.  This phase also addresses recovery effort documentation, activity log finalization, incorporation of lessons learned into plan updates, and readying resources for any future events.

             A full backup is the starting point for all other types of backup and contains
