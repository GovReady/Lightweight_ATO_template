    Contingency Plan

    In this module, we'll assist you in preparing a Contingency Plan document
    prior to the occurence of a disruption the guidelines and procedures for a 
    service disruption including:

    * notification and activation
    * recovery
    * reconstitution

    Will you leverage the template Information System Name and Identifier language used for CACE information systems?

    This ISCP has been developed for ISA which is classified as a impact system, in accordance with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199.  FIPS 199 provides guidelines on determining potential impact to organizational operations and assets, and individuals through a formula that examines three security objectives: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  The procedures in this ISCP have been developed for a impact system and are designed to recover the ISA within Recovery Time Objective (RTO) _Enter Number_ hours.  The replacement or purchase of new equipment, short-term disruptions lasting less than _Enter Number_, or loss of data at the primary facility or at the user-desktop levels is outside the scope of this plan.

    > * Disruption at the primary work site [[PRIMARY_WORK_SITE]]
    > * Disruption at the [VENDOR_PRIMARY_SITE]
    > * Disruption to the [[PARENT_AGENCY_ACRONYM]] [[NETWORK_CONNECTION]] direct circuits that connect users to the [[VENDOR_DATACENTER]].

    > This ITCP does not apply to the following situations:

    > * **Overall recovery and continuity of business operations.** The Business Resumption Plan (BRP) and Continuity of Operations (COOP) Plans are appended to this plan.
    > * **Emergency evacuation of personnel.** The Occumant Emergency Plan (OEP) is appended to this plan. As stated, this appended plan addresses occupant emergencies and is not the information system Contingency Plan.
